# ExpensifyAI

**Talk to your Splitwise. Get CRED-grade spending analytics.**

ExpensifyAI is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)
that lets any LLM client (Claude, etc.) manage shared expenses **and** produce deterministic,
premium spending analytics — category breakdowns, monthly trends, per-member comparisons, and
minimum-transaction settlement plans — rendered as a self-contained, offline HTML dashboard.

> Built on top of the excellent [tarunn2799/splitwise-mcp](https://github.com/tarunn2799/splitwise-mcp);
> extended with a deterministic analytics engine and a category-first dashboard.

## Analytics (what makes this ExpensifyAI)

- **Deterministic by construction** — every number is computed in pure Python with `Decimal`
  math (no float drift, no LLM estimation). Same input → byte-identical output. Each report
  carries a **reconciliation check**: per-expense shares must sum to cost, or the mismatch is flagged.
- **Category-first, à la CRED** — an expandable "where it goes" view leads every report; tap a
  category to drill into its transactions.
- **Seven analytics modules** — category breakdown · monthly trend · owed-vs-paid ("mine vs split")
  · per-member comparison + category×member matrix · transaction ledger · top transactions ·
  **settlement optimizer** (minimum transactions to settle a group — no other Splitwise tool has this).
- **Premium offline dashboard** — CRED-grade dark UI, hand-rolled inline-SVG charts, validated
  colorblind-safe palette, works with no network and no JS.
- **Two tools** — `analyze_spending(target_type, target_id?, dates?, generate_dashboard?)` and
  `compare_group_members(group_id, …)`. `target_type` is `me` | `group` | `friend`.

Try it without an account:

```bash
python examples/generate_demo.py   # writes examples/demo-dashboard.html
```

## Features (MCP)

- **Full API Access**: Manage expenses, groups, friends, and comments.
- **Natural Language Resolution**: Fuzzy matching for names ("John" -> "John Smith") and groups.
- **Dual Auth**: Supports both OAuth 2.0 (recommended) and API Keys.
- **Smart Caching**: Optimizes performance for static data like categories and currencies.

## Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (when published)
pip install splitwise-mcp-server

# From Source
git clone https://github.com/tarunn2799/splitwise-mcp-server
cd splitwise-mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed authentication and configuration instructions.

### Quick Config
Run the included setup script:
```
python -m splitwise_mcp_server.oauth_setup
```

Use the keys provided there, and add all three to your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "splitwise": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "splitwise_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "SPLITWISE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Get your Auth Keys**
> You can get your Consumer Key and Secret by registering an app at [https://secure.splitwise.com/apps](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps).

> **IMPORTANT:** Using a Virtual Environment?
> If you installed the package in a `venv` or Conda environment, you must use the **absolute path** to the python executable in your config.
>
> ```json
> "command": "/absolute/path/to/venv/bin/python"
> ```
> See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md#using-a-virtual-environment-venvconda) for details.

## Usage

The server enables natural language interactions with your Splitwise data.

**Examples:**
- "What's my current balance?"
- "Split a $50 dinner with Sarah."
- "Use the receipt I uploaded to split the dinner between Manav and me."
- "Show me expenses from last month."
- "Create a group called 'Ski Trip' with Mike."
